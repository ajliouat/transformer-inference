      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Optimized Transformer Inference Engine

A high-performance inference engine for transformer models, focusing on latency optimization and throughput maximization for production deployment.

## Features
- **Kernel Fusion Optimizations**: Reduce overhead by fusing multiple operations into a single kernel.
- **Dynamic Batching**: Maximize throughput by dynamically batching requests.
- **Custom Attention Patterns**: Support for custom attention mechanisms.
- **Int8 Quantization**: Reduce memory usage and improve performance with INT8 quantization.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- CUDA 11.x
- TensorRT 8.x
- CMake 3.14+

### Build Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transformer-inference.git
   cd transformer-inference
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build.sh
   ```

---

## Usage

To run the inference engine:
```bash

## Configuration

The `config.yaml` file is the central configuration for the project. Below is an example configuration:

```yaml
model_path: "models/transformer.onnx"  # Path to the model
batch_size: 8  # Batch size for inference
use_fp16: True  # Use FP16 precision
