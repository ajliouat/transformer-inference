# Design Document

## Overview
The Optimized Transformer Inference Engine is designed to maximize throughput and minimize latency for transformer models in production environments. It leverages CUDA, TensorRT, and custom optimizations like kernel fusion, dynamic batching, and INT8 quantization.

## Architecture
- **Inference Engine**: Core component for loading and running models.
- **Kernel Fusion**: Optimizes performance by fusing multiple operations into a single kernel.
- **Dynamic Batching**: Maximizes throughput by dynamically batching requests.
- **Custom Attention**: Supports custom attention patterns for specialized use cases.
- **Quantization**: Reduces memory usage and improves performance with INT8 quantization.
